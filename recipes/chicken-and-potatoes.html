    <img src="chickntatoes.webp" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken and Potatoes but now made in an air fryer instead of drying out in your oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Greek seasoning (such as Cavender's®)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Goya Sazonador Total</li>
        <li>2 pounds bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vinegar</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ pound baby red potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Mix paprika, garlic, onion powder, Greek seasoning, sazonador total, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Reserve 1 tablespoon seasoning in a small bowl; cover and set aside until needed for the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Place remaining seasoning in a 1-gallon resealable bag with water, 4 tablespoons olive oil, and vinegar. Add chicken thighs; massage to coat with seasoning, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Meanwhile, place 1 tablespoon reserved seasoning in a small bowl with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil; stir to combine. Toss potatoes in and stir until well coated. Combine potatoes and thighs in the air fryer basket.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Cook in the preheated air fryer until potatoes are tender and chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 28 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
